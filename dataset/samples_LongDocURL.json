Ashton-Tate marketed a popular line of dBASE programs, but several of their copyright certificates were inaccurate. FoxSoftware claimed that the copyrights were invalid and unenforceable due to Ashton-Tate's fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the applications. The court agreed and declared invalid all of Ashton-Tate's copyrights on its dBASE line of programs. However, the decision was suspect for several reasons, including the court's finding that the misstatements were made with an intent to deceive, the lack of a finding of prejudice to Fox, and the failure to consider Ashton-Tate's supplemental registrations. The decision had a significant impact on Ashton-Tate, as the invalidated dBASE products were the company's principal assets generating over $250 million in annual revenues.</description>\nSelect titles from the doc that best answer the question, do not alter or analyze the titles themselves.",

Many countries have well-established CMOs that manage a wide range of rights, including box office shares, TV broadcasting, and rental rights, with varying success across different rights and remuneration types as illustrated on pages 32 and 33.\n\nIn contrast, Latin American countries have a more uneven development of collective management systems. With a few exceptions, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, most countries lack robust frameworks, and audiovisual authors receive minimal remuneration beyond initial contracts with producers. Recent statutory amendments in Chile and Colombia aim to improve this by granting unwaivable remuneration rights managed by CMOs.

Components in the T4 temper displayed the largest dimensional growth, which is attributed to the continued aging of the alloy at elevated temperatures. In contrast, T6 tempered components showed moderate growth, and T7 tempered components showed the least dimensional growth due to the presence of theta prime (θ') and equilibrium theta (θ) phases. Comparative results demonstrated that higher operating temperatures accelerate aging leading to greater dimensional changes, as described on page 54 (Pure-text).",

State Attorneys General and the Federal Trade Commission, while key in privacy policymaking, have limited resources and other issues to manage. Even with sufficient resources, they lack the political leverage to impose significant fines that could deter companies effectively. Unlike these regulators, private lawsuits directly threaten companies with legal liability and compel them to adhere to the law preventively. For instance, Facebook's share price rose after the FTC fined it $5 billion, indicating that such fines were not a substantial enough deterrent. Similarly, Clearview AI stopped pursuing non-government contracts citing BIPA, showing the potency of private action.

Construction within regulated wetlands may require permits from the MDEQ and/or local Governing Body. If wetlands or low-lying areas are used for storm water storage, specific requirements apply depending on the presence of an outlet. Calculations may be required to ensure that runoff from a 100-year design storm does not exceed the finished grade elevation of adjacent structures. If a wetland is used for storm water storage, a sediment forebay must be provided upstream to reduce water velocity and encourage sedimentation.</description>\nSelect titles from the doc that best answer the question, do not alter or analyze the titles themselves.",
